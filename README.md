# StayAwakeBluetooth #wakeywakey 
Simple C# .Net Console app to keep your bluetooth speaker awake.

I recently bought a new bluetooth speaker.  Quickly found out its got this really annoying feature, that cannot be disabled, where is goes into "energy saving" mode after 15mins, even when mains powered.
So I wrote this app that plays a silent mp3 file every 10 mins to keep it awake.
It's simple and works great.

**How to use:**
Run the exe. A console window will open, minimise it if you wish and leave it alone.
It'll write a console msg every 10 mins saying its playing the file.
Pressing Space or closing the window will terminate the app.
