# StayAwakeBluetooth #wakeywakey 
Simple Console app to keep bluetooth speaker awake.

I recently bought a new bluetooth speaker.  Quickly found out its got this really annoying feature, that cannot be disabled, where is goes into "energy saving" mode after 15mins, even when mains powered.
So I wrote this app that plays a silent mp3 file every 10 mins to keep it awake.
It's simple and works great.
